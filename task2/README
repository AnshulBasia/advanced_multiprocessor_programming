Specification
=============

Implement a lock-free cuckoo hash table using pheet and C++11 atomics.

Expectations
============

* Efficient and correct implementation.
* Good theoretical analysis (invariants, linearizability, progress guarantees).
* Good benchmark analysis.
* Short document: 2-4 pages excluding plots and sourcecode. Description of data structure. Theoretical analysis. Benchmark (results, process).

Dependencies
============

* Pheet (www.pheet.org)

For this task, we used revision 420. After pulling pheet itself, make sure
to point CMake to the correct directory.

TODO: Adapt these instructions to the set benchmarks.

To integrate the PCN into pheet's benchmarks:

* Include our pcn.h in test/count_bench/CountBench.cpp
* Add a new run_bench() call to run_test()
* Activate the count benchmark in test/settings.h
* Add the include path in settings.mk
* make test && bin/pheet_test
* Optionally use csvheet to convert the output into a usable CSV format

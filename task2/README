Specification
=============

Implement a parallel cuckoo hash table using pheet and C++11 atomics.

Expectations
============

* Efficient and correct implementation.
* Good theoretical analysis (invariants, linearizability, progress guarantees).
* Good benchmark analysis.
* Short document: 2-4 pages excluding plots and sourcecode. Description of data
  structure. Theoretical analysis. Benchmark (results, process).

Dependencies
============

* Pheet (www.pheet.org)

For this task, we used revision 420. After pulling pheet itself, make sure
to point CMake to the correct directory.

To integrate the PCN into pheet's benchmarks:

* Include our cuckooset.hpp in test/set_bench/SetBench.cpp
* Add a new run_bench() call to run_test()
* Set ACTIVE_TEST to "test_variants/amp/set.h" in test/settings.h
* In settings.mk, set the:
    * Include path: INCLUDE_PATH = -I. -I../path/to/task2/src
    * Library search path as well as link libraries:
      TEST_LIBS = -L../path/to/task2/build/src/ -lcuckooset
* make test && LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../path/to/task2/build/src/ bin/pheet_test
* Optionally use csvheet to convert the output into a usable CSV format

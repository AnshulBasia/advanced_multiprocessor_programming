Specification
=============

Implement a periodic counting network using pheet and C++11 atomics.
Compare performance to fetch-and-increment (using pheet benchmarks).
Compare sequential with relaxed consistency.
5-minute presentation with experience, performance, code, stability, pitfalls.

Dependencies
============

* Pheet (www.pheet.org)

For this task, we used revision 420. After pulling pheet itself, make sure
to point CMake to the correct directory.

To integrate the PCN into pheet's benchmarks:

* Include our pcn.h in test/count_bench/CountBench.cpp
* Add a new run_bench() call to run_test()
* Activate the count benchmark in test/settings.h
* Add the include path in settings.mk
* make test && bin/pheet_test
* Optionally use csvheet to convert the output into a usable CSV format
